# 15O
Data, code, and notes for "15O: Fraud or fatigue?"

Note: The mesa-level voting results were posted online by the CNE here:

http://www4.cne.gob.ve/resultados_regionales2017/#

A preliminary version of results scraped from the CNE site can be found here:

However, the scraped version of the results does not include the código of each centro de votación (precinct), which makes it difficult to merge to results from previous elections.

Therefore, the data we use for the article come from a results file distributed by the CNE. This file has the advantage of including códigos of each centro; it has the disadvantage of not being entirely complete: the file was distributed before the tally was 100% complete. Vote totals in these data therefore differ slightly from those on the CNE website. We expect that, once the scraped data have been merged to the data from previous years, re-running the analysis will not substantially change our results.
